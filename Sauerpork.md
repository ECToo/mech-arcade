**Windows version for release in 1st Q 2010, Linux version mid 2010, Mac version, whenever!**
**NOTE: after this we will switch to Blood Frontier engine**
#### Why Sauerpork? ####
  * we developed this as a test during the proof of concept phase. We wanted to test the code chain, versioning and the general principle
  * it has allowed us to continue development and design while waiting for BF to settle, and kept the team moving forward and gave us a win
  * we released it because others might find it fun and useful
  * the name was originally Sauerpig, the pig bit came from the fact it 'piggybacked' over a  Sauerbraten install. Pork sounded a bit better, so we cooked up Sauerpork.
#### Features ####
  * will not affect preexisiting SB install
  * runs piggyback without affecting SB set up ie reads different config files
  * will still be able to run SB content
  * only tweaks to FPS gameplay (better ai) will leave it compatible with SB online so you can still use the Sauerbraten servers
  * had more scifi style models (battle armor, droids, mechs) rather than the Hellpig and its cronies
  * improved GUI
#### Installation ####
  * Download Sauerbraten
  * Install Sauerbraten, note where it is installed
  * Download Sauerpork and unzip it directly into the Sauerbraten root folder.
