#summary Requirement for a Mech model.
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase1
The basic model is all that would be needed for phase 1 testing and developing a 'reference mech', while the complex model with all the goodies would be needed for release. During Phase 2 we probably actually need 2 reference mechs, a chicken walker and human style.
===Basic Model===
The model would need the following basic animations:
  *  Run
  *  Walk
  *  Torso Rotation 
  *  Gimped (damgaged and limping)
  *  Destroyed
  *  A basic weapon to fire if possible

Format: MD3 or MD5, importable into Blood Frontier/Cube

===Complex Model===
  *  Basic Model Animations as described above.
  *  Damage Effects
  *  Heat Effects - possibly
  *  Weapons 
  *  Jumpjets - for some, eventulally 
  *  Defense - one of Nullsig, Cloak, Antimissile or Shield. 
  *  ??keep taunt, can a mech taunt? - _'I exhaust my plasma waste in your general direction'_
  *  ??Others
