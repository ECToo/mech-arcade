#labels Phase-Design
= Using Blood Frontier =

We have been a bit quite on the development front with Xmas, holidays and birthdays. During this time BF 0.85 has been released (called the beta 2). It seems very stable and includes some nice enhancement.

Broadly the plan for the next 3 months is: 

1. Recompile thwe BF engine to use different configuration files and few cosmetic differneces - same as sauerpig
2. Otherwise leave the engine alone
3. Work on maps and mech models
4. Work out how to alter the player model to accomadate mech behavoirs  
5. Implement the game pad using joystick to kbd/mouse mapping - see below

= Using the Gamepad =

I managed to get the gamepad to work (buggy) using some old code Sauerbraten code that I found in a mod. However I am not confident I can get it to work in BF some I looked at using 3rd party joystick to kbd/mouse mappers - I tried JoyToKey, which is a piece of Win32 freeware. I have got it about 70% right for BF. I have the app and the config files here
