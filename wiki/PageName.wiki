This follows on from the [Heat] page.

=== Developing a Mech Class===
I have started with the headings taken from the [http://mechbay.teamxbow.org/simpledb1/mechdata1.php Mechbay Datasheet] which uses data from Shaow Panthers site. This is the only data I have. Ultimately the mechs weight determines the amount of 'stuff' the mech can carry and at what speed. These I believe are loosely based on the rules from the MW universe.  
  *  Weight - fixed. 
  *  Armor - very important.  
  *  Speed - speeds in game are not what is published.
  *  Torso Rotation - a very important constraint.  
  *  Class - arbitary term eg assault, light etc 
  *  MxHeat - max 200 htu
  *  CoolRate - max 20 htu/s
  *  Weapons - complex, will have it's own section!
  *  Salvage - Armor Amount & types: Sal-Energy Sal-Ball Sal-Miss 
  *  Jumpjets - Speed & time, will have it's own section!
  *  Defense - one of Nullsig, Cloak, Antimissile or Shield Will have it's own section!
