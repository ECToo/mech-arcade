#summary Sauerpork is a modded Sauerbraten(SB) for piggyback installation

==== Why Sauerpork? ====
  * we developed this as a test, a test of the code chain, versioning and of the principle
  * allows us to continue code development and design while waiting for BF to settle
  * keeps the tam moving forward and gives us a win
==== Features ====
  * will not affect preexisiting SB install
  * runs piggyback without affecting SB set up ie reads different config files
  * will still be able to run SB content
  * only tweaks to FPS gameplay (better ai) will leave it compatible with SB online so you can still use the Sauerbraten servers
  * had more scifi models
  * improved GUI
  * Windows version for release in December 2009, Linux version early 2010, Mac version, whenever!
