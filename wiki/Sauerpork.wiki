#summary Sauerpork is a spinoff from MekArcade that is modded Sauerbraten(SB) for piggyback installation
*Windows version for release in December 2009, Linux version early 2010, Mac version, whenever!*
==== Why Sauerpork? ====
  * we developed this as a test during the proof of concept phase. We wanted to test the code chain, versioning and of the principle
  * allows us to continue code development and design while waiting for BF to settle, keeps the team moving forward and gives us a win
  * we released it because others might find it fun and useful
  * the name was originally SauerPig, the pig bit came from the fact it 'piggybacked' over a  Sauerbraten install. Pork sounded a bit better, so we cooked up SauerPork.
==== Features ====
  * will not affect preexisiting SB install
  * runs piggyback without affecting SB set up ie reads different config files
  * will still be able to run SB content
  * only tweaks to FPS gameplay (better ai) will leave it compatible with SB online so you can still use the Sauerbraten servers
  * had more scifi style models (battle armor, droids, mechs) rather than the Hellpig and its cronies
  * improved GUI
==== Installation ====
