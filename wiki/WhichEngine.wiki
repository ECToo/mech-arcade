= Which Engine =

The 'which engine' issue needs to be sorted out by Xmas, because after that I will have to work on how the model and integrates with the engine and the input devices.  That could be tricky.  . 

== I want to use Red Eclipse because..... ==

  # core breech effect (kamikaze 3)
  # script access to lots of other game variables eg jumpspeed
  # proper team spawns, 
  # sqaud play 
  # jump jets
  # multiplayer triggers (needed for destructible terrain)
  # player class (necc. for implementing mechs properly)
  # better bot ai
  # looks better

== I won't use Red Eclipse if.... ==

  # Buggy, unreliable
  # couldn't compile - had this problem, SDL library was wrong
  # can't get md3 player models or can't get md5 mechs made.
 
== RE test.... ==

First looks are very positive. note - The working game model is showing the same ‘firey feet’ 

  # Try Mapmodels
  # Try HUD
  # Try import Maps
  # Try build Maps
  # Try triggers
  # Learn how the server stuff works 
  # Set up server (sugarman)
  # Mecha models (walter)
  # Testing (tom)

So the show stopper remains the mecha models. Walter is trying an md5 export from Max, and I will continue to investigate the use of md3 AFTER completeing the list above
