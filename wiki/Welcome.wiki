#summary Welcome page and a quick state of play
= Introduction =

Welcome to the MechArcade wiki. I have done some preliminary work on the project which you can catch up with here in the TeamXbow [http://mechbay.teamxbow.org/cube_to_mech.htm Mechbay]

= Game Engine Base =

I have been looking at the 2 most likely candidates as the game engine base. Either Blood Frontier http://bloodfrontier.com or Sauerbraten http://sauerbraten.org, though I am leaning toward Blood. 

Another option may be the content free version of Sauerbraten that is being put together.

At this point in time it doesn't matter too much as we are not planning to edit the game code in the first phase. 

= The Plan =

==Step 1 - Proof of concept - 3 months==

Get a mech model into current maps, a basic a proof of concept. 
Reskin the GUI to make it more mech like, including radar
Set up the 'tool chains' for code, models, maps and graphics

*Note 1:* Main difference(s) between a MA style mech the current player model: 

the torso rotation and effects of gait 
the damage fx and gimping 
targeting fx (nullsig, chaff) 
invisibility 
weapon handling 
heat management 
Note 2: The Mech would be a player not a vehicle b/c the cube engine doesn't do vehicles without modding the source

Start with only a few people, a lead, a modder, map maker, a C coder (if possible, I would be hoping not to mod the engine ) and someone network/server savvy. These would form the basis of the 'teams' as more join


= Models =

The single biggest issue is the models - you can read about my misadventures here in the[http://mechbay.teamxbow.org/cube_to_mech.htm Mechbay]
