== Functionality Issues ==

The engine offers a bit more than MA uses. So this is what's in and what's out.

  *  POV: ?3rd or 1st or both Probably Both 
  *  Jump Jets: will probably need engine and model changes, possibly could be scripted 
  *  Jumping: cube does it already. ?turn if off? ?could it be adapted for jump jets 
  *  Pilots and Battlearmor - Probably Not 
  *  VTOL - Probably Not
  *  Alpha Strike -  Probably Not
  *  Reduce weapon types  Probably forced too. 
  *  Add Controller support
  *  Mech behaviors - try to reproduce all. See [MechClass] and [MechModelRequirement] 
  *  Engine changes needed to support the mech gameplay. [ExploringEngine] 
  *  Balance mechs better - Probably because of forced weapon changes 
  *  Destructible Terrain see [DestructibleTerrain]
