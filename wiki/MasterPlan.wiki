*Mission Objective: Reproduce MA1 online game play using the Cube Engine*
==Step 1 - Proof of concept - Ver 0.1 3 months==
Get a mech model into current maps, as a basic a proof of concept. Reskin the GUI to make it more Mech like, Set up the [TooChains 'tool chains'] for code, models, maps and graphics. Mod as much as possible with the config. Learn the engine. Work out key concepts needed eg mech classs, see more on the [MechClass] page, [Heat heat cycle] etc, game model requirements [MechModelRequirement game model requirements]

See updates and progress at [Phase1]

==Step 2 - Get the old Mechassault feel - Ver 0.2 6 months==
  * Add controller support 
  * heat management - definitely need significant additions to the engine. [Heat] 
  * Develop the mech model into a 'reference mech'. 2 actually, one for chicken walkers and one for human style gait. Include all base behaviors (walking, running, falling, exploding etc). 
  * Start work on how to do the weapons 
The teams would start to form:
  * Engine Team 
  * Map Making 
  * Modelers 
  * Network & Testing 
==Step 3 - Base Game - Ver 0.3 9 to 12 months==
We have 2 reference mechs, and a game that works and feels like MA
1. Develop a few more mechs from the reference designs
2. Work on Weapons - missiles, gauss, PPC,  MG, lasers, hammers 
3. Develop a few test good test maps (?replicate some classic MA maps) with some destructible terrain 
4. Make all the above work together as best as possible, without significant mods to engine. What's missing?  Is it a problem with the engine, models or maps. Does it need an engine mod?
==Step 4 - Finishing the Basics - Ver 0.4 12 to 18 months==
1. Engine Mods - see below
2. Work on weapons
3. Work on maps inc destructibles
4. Add voice coms here (? use Xfire or teamspeak)
Test, refine, test etc
 If OK proceed to 5
==Step 5 - Alpha release - Ver 0.5 Around 24 months==
Aim at about half a dozen mechs and maps for Alpha.
1. Major test including volume testing
2. Map development would continue
3. Mech development would continue 
==Step 6 - Post Alpha  Ver 0.6 == 
1. Fix problem identified in alpha
2. Ideally map and mech development would be finished by the end of this
==Step 7 -  Beta release 1.0 Beta==
1. Major test including all release maps
2. No new map or model development 
==Step 8 -  Post release V 1.1==
1. Fix problem identified by users
2. Community development groups
==Step 9 - Version 1.5== 
1. Add the good community maps, mods, mechs and models.
2. Fix bugs
3. Develop functional spec for 2.0
Persisting world aka MA2 conquest 
Mission bookings/game scheduling 
VTOL and other vehicles (significant engine changes)
