=== Engine 0.80 Beta===
This is the 'Beta' release from Feb 09, which was a pretty tight piece of work. So far all our experiment have been on this version.


=== Engine 0.84 Dev===

This has been the first Dev release to tempt me. Radar working properly, enhanced weapons. Indeed for someone wanting to do a mech shooter, the upgraded weapon effects are beoming very close to those needed. The laser rifle has a real beam now, the plasma gun has a charged up ball effect like a PPC.
