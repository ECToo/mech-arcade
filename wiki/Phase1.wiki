== Parts of Phase 1 ==
Nov 20th 2009 : Sauerpork is a spinoff using a slightly modified the Sauerbraten Engine. See [Sauerpork]
Sept 2010 - 12 months late but looks like we might have the demo out for this Xmas New Year!
=== 1. Tool Chain ===
- 100% done. See [ToolChains], models, which were the greatest problem, have been sorted out.
=== 2. Configuration and Scripting ===
BF offers many options to configure and script, for example some easy changes to mimic Mech behavoir  eg:
  *  kamikaze -  set to 3 makes a mech like explosion
  *  maxhealth - Inceased global health to 500 gives a much mech like game play 
  *  jumpscale - set to zero this stops them jumping around like grasshoppers
  *  _Note:_ these are for BF, most are differt from SB
To give a mechassault style third person perspective you can use these commands below. Note that I had to spend a bit of time fiddling to get the aim correct in 3rd person
  *  thirdperson 1
  *  thirdpersondist 40 Camera distance from the player model, 
  *  thirdpersonshift 0
  *  thirdpersonangle 45
  *  -Note: SB does not have these commands. Need to change engine to adjust 3rd person
=== 3. Compiling, C and the Engine ===
  *  Installed code::blocks and MWGNU compiler *OK*
  *  Recompiled engine with minor changes *OK*
  *  set up a code/project repository *OK*
  *  Status:  Functional
Todo: 
  *  Explore engine - see [ExploringEngine here.]
  *  Define needs - always a bit slippery
  *  find C coder
=== 4. Maps & Map Tool Chain === 
  *  Basic map editing *OK*
  *  Status:  Functional
 *  -Note: I will never be a map maker. Tom will try.
Todo next: 
  *  See how to import/export .obj files
  *  Gain proficency in map making
  *  find map makers - try commisioniing.
===  5. Model & Model Tool Chain === 
GMax to the rescue. I can now 
  *  now I can work with md2/3/5 files.  Misfit and Milkshape do MD2/3_ 
  *  think about how to implement heat and health into models. - see [Heat]
  *  think about weapons (most md2) - see [Weapons] 
  *  think about destructible terrain - see [DestructibleTerrain]
  *  find modellers!!! (maybe purchase/competion)

=== 6. GUI, Graphics & Graphics Tool Chain === 
  *  Graphics Tool Chain - *OK*
  *  Able to modify GUI - *OK*
  *  Able to modify Bootup - *OK* see image above
  *  Able to modify HUD -  probably OK
  *  Status - Functional 
=== 7. Engine Mods === 
I was really hoping to avoid any mods, but there will have to be more than I hoped. For phase 1 the only engine mods will be non critical, and a chance to get to grips with C and the tools.:
  * Controller Mod > have downloaded the old joystick mod. SDL library comes with joytick lib, so this may be able to be used. Hopefully a good place to start.
  * Alter config file names *OK*  
  * Mech movement -  torso rotation (possibly if I can get a decent mech model working)
Unfortunately it is clear there will have to be a number of engine chages to give the real mechassault experience. For the moment these are in phase 2 & 3. The following will have to be added to the engine:
   * Heat Management (current temp, heat rate, cool rate, effects on weapons and visibility, see [Heat]. I think I will put this off to later, if at all. 
  * Mech behavoirs (flying, gimped are misssing from the engine)
  * Mech Damage 
  * Weapons -  heaps of issues, but some parts may be easier than I thought,[Weapons here].
  * Target locking, target jamming, chaff,  
  * Mech Types
  * Mech Selection and room management
  * Security and anticheating strategies.
