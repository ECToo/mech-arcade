#summary Engine and model mods - 1st draft
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design

== Engine Mods == 

I was hopeful of no engine mods, however there are a number of behavoirs and functions that will probably require engine +/- model changes. 

1. Weapons 
Some changes would be necessary.  The more you could use original code the better. You need the projectile & the fx, not the actual weapon, thus you could probably remove actual weapon models given the mech POV. I had some thoughts about this a while ago, which I put up at the mechbay, including names. Visit  http://mechbay.teamxbow.org/mechassault_to_cube_weapons.htm

2. Health pickup after death
The goodies may be able to be managed with the current engine

3. HUD & GUI
Looks like all can be done without engine changes

4. Mech behaviors
The engine/models would have to  
  *  Actions: Running, Walking, Flying, Gimped,
  *  Heat management
  *  Damage Fx (impact animation, visual damage cues, gimping)

5. Input
A joy stock controller mod does exist, have downloaded and will see if I can adapt it

6. Physics
Cude does basic collision stuff (?more or less than MA1)

== Major Model Changes == 

  *  Damage effects
  *  Ragdoll behavior at death, needs explosion
  *  Torso rotation
  *  Flying
  *  Targeting effects (targeting, tracking, null sig, chaff)
  *  Invisibility

== HUD == 

  *  Radar - should be able to be turned on
  *  Graphics/Style - can do already

== Menu & GUI == 

  *  Layout - can do already
  *  Graphics/Style - can do already
