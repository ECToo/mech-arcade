#summary Engine and model mods - 1st draft
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design
== Engine Mods == 
I was hopeful of no engine mods, however there are a number of behavoirs and functions that will probably require engine +/- model changes.
 
  *  Weapons - Some changes would be necessary.  The more you could use original code the better. You need the projectile & the fx, not the actual weapon, thus you could probably remove actual weapon models given the mech POV. I had some thoughts about this a while ago, which I put up at the mechbay, including names. Visit  http://mechbay.teamxbow.org/mechassault_to_cube_weapons.htm
  *  Health pickup after death - the goodies may be able to be managed with the current engine
  *  Heat - complex see [Heat]
  *  Mech Actions: - Torso rotation, Running, Walking, Flying, Gimped,
  *  Mech Damage Fx - impact animation, body visual damage cues, smoke
  *  Input - A joy stock controller mod does exist, have downloaded and will see if I can adapt it
  *  Physics - Cube does basic collision stuff (?more than MA1) and recoil (customizable)

== Major Model Changes == 

  *  Damage effects
  *  Ragdoll behavior at death, needs explosion
  *  Torso rotation NB MD2 files cant do rotation well because no body pivot, MD3 does
  *  Flying
  *  Targeting effects (targeting, tracking, null sig, chaff)
  *  Invisibility
