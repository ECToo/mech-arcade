#summary Engine and model mods - 1st draft
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design

== Engine Mods == 

I was hopeful of no engine mods, however there are a number of behavoirs and functions that will probably require engine +/- model changes

1. Weapons 
Some changes would be necessary.  The more you could use original code the better. You need the projectile & the fx,  as you would probably remove actual weapon models given the mech POV. 

2. Health pickup after death
The goodies may be able to be managed with the current engine

3. HUD & GUI
Looks like all can be done without engine changes

4 Mech behaviors
The engine/models would have to  
  *  Actions: Running, Walking, Flying, Gimped,
  *  Heat management
  *  Damage Fx (impact animation, visual damage cues, gimping)

5. Input
A joy stock controller mod does exist, have downloaded and will see if I can adapt it

6. Physics
Cude does basic collision stuff (?more or less than MA1)


== Major Model Changes == 

1. Damage effects
2. Ragdoll behavior at death, needs explosion
3. Torso rotation
4. Flying
5. Targeting effects (targeting, tracking, null sig, chaff)
6. Invisibility

== HUD == 

1. Radar - should be able to be turned on
2. Graphics/Style - can do already

== Menu & GUI == 

1. Layout - can do already
2. Graphics/Style - can do already
